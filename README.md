# Minesweeper_Board_Creator

The Minesweeper Game Board Generator is a Python program that creates a row * column solution board for the popular game Minesweeper. Build the program ensures that the user enters integers between 5-10 for the grid size and number of mines and handles invalid user input gracefully and prompts the user to re-enter valid input by “check_input” function. Implemented functions utilizes a nested loop and 2D lists to iterate through the eight neighboring locations and appropriately increments a counter for each mine encountered.

## Features:
- Customizable grid size and number of mines
- Random mine placement that ensures correct number of mines
- Counting of mines in adjacent squares (diagonals included)
- Display of the filled grid
- Error checking of user input
- Documented functions for easy understanding and modification
